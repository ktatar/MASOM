# Training on your own dataset

- Create a folder for your dataset. Name doesn't matter. We will refer to this folder as dataset_folder from now on.
- Your dataset_folder should have a folder named "audio", notice the no-caps. Inside "audio", you should have your wave files. Only wave files work because of MuBu. If your files are in another type, you can easily convert them using Audacity:
